          <p class="hero-intro">
            This page gathers <strong>ready-to-use music suites for contemporary dance</strong>.
            Each piece has been composed with <strong>movement, phrasing and stage energy</strong> in mind:
            solos, duos, group sections, floor work, traveling and final tableaux.

            <h2>Why this music works well for contemporary dance</h2>
            <p>
              As a composer and dance filmmaker, Vincent writes music directly from the body:
              <strong>weight, breath, suspension, impact</strong>. The tracks below are designed to help you:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>structure a <strong>full-length piece</strong> (10–30 minutes),</li>
              <li>build short <strong>solos and duos</strong> for workshops, exams or auditions,</li>
              <li>explore specific energies: <strong>slow tension, release, momentum, trance, stillness</strong>,</li>
              <li>have <strong>immediately usable, high-quality sound</strong> without spending weeks searching online.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You can freely <strong>listen, rehearse and experiment</strong> with the music. If you decide to present
              the piece in public (festival, exam, competition, school show, theatre), you can simply

          <section>
            <h2>Suite 1 — Slow Tension & Inner Narrative</h2>
            <p>
              A continuous suite built from ambient textures, sparse piano and low pulses. Perfect for
              <strong>solo or duo work</strong> exploring vulnerability, internal conflict and slow transformation.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Use for:</strong> floor work, opening solos, intimate scenes.</li>
              <li><strong>Energy:</strong> soft, tense, introspective.</li>
              <li><strong>Tempo:</strong> slow pulse, around 70–80 BPM feel.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Recommended tracks to explore from Vincent’s catalog:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="/mystic.html">“Mystic” — dark cinematic soundtrack for psychological movement</a></li>
              <li><a href="/le-lac-ost.html">“Le Lac” — ambient sections with minimal piano</a></li>
            </ul>

          <section>
            <h2>Suite 2 — Liquid Motion & Travel</h2>
            <p>
              This suite is built around <strong>liquid drum &amp; bass</strong> aesthetics: flowing breaks, deep bass
              and wide harmonies. It works particularly well for <strong>group pieces</strong> with traveling phrases,
              jumps and structured unisons.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Use for:</strong> group sections, diagonal phrases, technical sequences.</li>
              <li><strong>Energy:</strong> moving, expansive, cinematic.</li>
              <li><strong>Tempo:</strong> 160–174 BPM, with enough space to breathe between hits.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Inspired by Vincent’s <strong>liquid drum &amp; bass work</strong> and the more rhythmic parts of
              <a href="/le-lac-ost.html">“Le Lac” soundtrack</a>.
            </p>

          <section>
            <h2>Suite 3 — Climaxes & Final Tableaux</h2>
            <p>
              A selection of cues focusing on <strong>build-up, impact and resolution</strong>, ideal for the last
              third of a piece or for competition choreography where timing is crucial.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Use for:</strong> final scenes, large group images, high emotional intensity.</li>
              <li><strong>Energy:</strong> elevated, cathartic, bright or dark depending on your choice.</li>
              <li><strong>Tempo:</strong> flexible — from slow build to explosive release.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to use this music in rehearsal</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Start with <strong>free exploration</strong> on one track, then identify your key moments.</li>
              <li>Decide which parts of the music you want to <strong>keep, cut or loop</strong>.</li>
              <li>Build your choreography structure (A / B / C) around <strong>energy changes</strong> in the music.</li>
