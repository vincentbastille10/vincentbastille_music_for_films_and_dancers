          <h1>Le Lac — Original Motion Picture Soundtrack</h1>
          <p class="hero-intro">
            <strong>“Le Lac”</strong> is an immersive soundtrack built for cinema, contemporary dance and visual
            arts. The score travels between <strong>ambient atmospheres, liquid drum &amp; bass rhythms, trip-hop
            echoes and minimal piano</strong>, creating a fluid sonic environment around memory, water and inner
            transformation.

            <h2>An ambient, liquid &amp; piano-driven score</h2>
            <p>
              Inspired by the shifting reflections of a summer lake, “Le Lac” explores <strong>slow-moving ambient
              textures, deep basslines and delicate piano motifs</strong>. The soundtrack was composed to support
              a film where sound, memory and landscape are deeply connected.
            </p>
            <p>
              The music moves from intimate, almost whispered sections to more expansive movements where
              <strong>liquid drum &amp; bass</strong> pulses appear under the surface, giving choreographers and
              editors multiple layers of energy to work with.
            </p>
            <p>
              References include <strong>Erik Satie</strong> for the piano’s clarity, <strong>Portishead</strong> and
              trip-hop culture for the grain and textures, and <strong>LTJ Bukem</strong> for the liquid, atmospheric
              feel of the rhythm sections.

            <h2>About the film “Le Lac”</h2>
            <p>
              “Le Lac” is a medium-length film written and directed by Vincent Bastille, produced by Spectra Media
              Prod. Shot around a lake and in the region of Le Mans, it blends intimate drama, mystery and
              <strong>experimental sound work</strong> including hydrophones and natural reverberation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The soundtrack was written in close dialogue with the images and locations, making it particularly
              suitable for projects exploring <strong>memory, water, disappearance, reflection and doubles</strong>.
