          <p class="hero-intro">
            <strong>“Mystic”</strong> is a dark cinematic soundtrack built around slow-burning tension, inner voices and
            fragile melodies. Composed for a psychological short film, it also works as a
            <strong>ready-to-use score for contemporary dance and visual storytelling</strong>.

            <h2>A cinematic soundtrack designed for movement &amp; tension</h2>
            <p>
              “Mystic” lives in the space between <strong>ambient sound design, trip-hop shadows and subtle rhythmic
              pulses</strong>. The music was written to follow a character’s inner journey: doubt, fascination, fear,
              obsession — emotions that immediately translate to the body on stage.
            </p>
            <p>
              The score moves through slow drones, delicate piano patterns, distant voices and sudden rises in
              intensity. Instead of filling every space, it <strong>leaves room for silence, breath and choreography</strong>,
              giving performers the freedom to build their own phrases and dynamics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Influences include <strong>Portishead</strong>, minimal piano in the spirit of <strong>Erik Satie</strong>,
              atmospheric textures reminiscent of <strong>Future Sound of London</strong>, and the deep emotional drive
              found in <strong>liquid drum &amp; bass</strong>.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Why “Mystic” works particularly well for contemporary dance</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Built-in <strong>crescendos</strong> for physical tension and group sections.</li>
              <li>Suspended, spacious parts ideal for <strong>floor work</strong> and slow exploration.</li>
              <li>Subtle rhythmic phrases for <strong>travel, jumps and momentum</strong>.</li>
              <li>A strong <strong>narrative arc</strong> that can support solo, duo or ensemble pieces.</li>
              <li>A sound palette that feels modern yet intimate, easy to integrate into festivals and venues.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="section-note">
              Many sections can be used as standalone cues — you can cut, loop or reorder parts of the soundtrack to
              match your choreographic structure.
